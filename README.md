# COMP__3359__GROUP8

This is the repository for COMP3359 in HKU. In this project, we will apply what we have learned from the course (e.g., problem framing, AI/ML model design, experiment and practical considerations & techniques) and design & implement a problem of our own choice.



Please paste the following large files in the drive under the "data" folder:

Dataset for sentiment analysis:

Dataset for topic classification:

Dataset for final analytics: https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/reddit-top-1000?select=GetMotivated.csv



Instruction in running the ipynb notebook:
As we can see in the github repository there are two folders, ignore the data folder which contains basically data, focus on the script folder. For sentiment analysis, follow Sentiment.ipynb  -> sentiment_bayes.ipynb -> sentiment_NN.ipynb -> sentiment_rnn.ipynb. For topic classification, follow topic_bayes.ipynb -> Topic.ipynb -> RNN.ipynb. Finally run Final.ipynb.


Corresponding usage of the ipynb files are as follows:
Sentiment.ipynb: data sampling for sentiment analysis
sentiment_bayes.ipynb: sentiment * bayes model
sentiment_NN.ipynb: sentiment * neural network model
sentiment_rnn.ipynb: sentiment * recurrent neural network model
topic_bayes.ipynb: sentiment * bayes model
Topic.ipynb: sentiment * neural network  model
RNN.ipynb: sentiment * recurrent neural network model
Final: application & analysis
